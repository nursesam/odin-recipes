    <h2>About this Recipe:</h2>
    <p1>This is a simple way to cook BBQ Pulled chicken.  It requires a few simple indgredients and minimal effort.
        It will require about 5 hours to cook using a slow cooker.  Shred the chicken while it's how to make it simple.
        You can eat on any type of bun.  Pretzel buns toasted with butter are my favorite.

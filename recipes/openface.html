    <h2>This is a recipe for how to make turkey burgers.  It just uses 3 indgredients.  I get turkey rolls from Aldis.  
        I make 4 burgers out of each 1 lb roll so get as much as you will need.
    </h2>
    <h2>Indgredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb roll of ground turkey</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>pepper</li>
        <li>cheese and other burger toppings of your choice</li>
        <li>buns of your choice</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Separate ground turkey into 4 equal parts.  Manipulate into thin burgers.  Press a hole in the center with your finger.
        Tip: Only manipulate the meat as much as needed to get the proper shape.  It will taste better if it isn't mashed much.</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper each side of patties to taste</li>
        <li>Cook on heated grill.  Flip once.  Use a meat thermometer to determine when done.</li>
